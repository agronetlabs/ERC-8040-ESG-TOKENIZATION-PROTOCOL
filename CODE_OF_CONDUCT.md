## 🧭 ATF-AI Code of Conduct

**Last Updated:** 2025‑10‑31  
This Code of Conduct governs the behavior of all participants and operators interacting with the ATF-AI (AgroCrypto Trust Framework — AI-Governed DAO).

---

### 1. AI-Governed Compliance
ATF-AI is governed by artificial intelligence. No human vote is required to determine the eligibility of token issuance. All participants must adhere to the AI-based compliance logic.

---

### 2. Verifiable Data and Auditability
Participants are required to submit data in structured formats that allow cryptographic validation. Any attempt to circumvent, forge, or bypass verification processes will result in immediate disqualification.

---

### 3. Zero Tolerance for Greenwashing
Greenwashing practices, misleading sustainability claims, or unverifiable ESG projects are strictly prohibited. The ATF-AI enforces transparent and evidence-based ESG disclosure.

---

### 4. Interoperability and Institutional Standardization
All tokens issued under ATF-AI must comply with recognized standards (e.g., ERC‑8040). Projects are required to ensure cross-chain operability and alignment with institutional-grade identifiers (ISIN, LEI, etc.).

---

### 5. No Place for Corruption or Gatekeepers
ATF-AI operates without human gatekeepers, intermediaries, or biased institutions. Its AI core ensures autonomous, merit-based, and incorruptible compliance logic.

---

### 6. Public Transparency
All tokenization decisions, validations, and compliance outcomes are permanently recorded on-chain and may be publicly audited at any time. Transparency is not optional — it is embedded.

---

### 7. Sanctions and Enforcement
Any entity found to violate this Code will be subject to enforcement, including revocation of “ATF-AI Verified” status, public blacklisting, and technical deactivation of issued tokens.
