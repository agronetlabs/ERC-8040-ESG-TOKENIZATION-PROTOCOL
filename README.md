# Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)

> **_ATTENTION_**: The EIPs repository has recently [undergone](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7206) a separation of ERCs and EIPs. ERCs are now accessible at [https://github.com/ethereum/ercs](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs). All new ERCs and updates to existing ones must be directed at this new repository. The editors apologize for this inconvenience.

## 🚀 Excellence in Blockchain, Compliance & Security

**AgroCrypto Quantum Core** is a reference implementation of the **AgroCrypto Quantum Governance — ESG Tokenization Protocol (EIP Draft)**.  
Built 100% in pure, clean Rust, it delivers a **compliance-grade, AI-native, and post-quantum secure** framework for institutional ESG asset tokenization.

Unlike legacy “enterprise” stacks, this project embodies the very best in modern engineering: deterministic, audit-ready, and aligned with international standards for security and governance.

## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

- **100% pure, maintainable, and auditable Rust codebase**
- **Badges for compliance, audit, open licensing, CI/CD, provenance**
- **Detailed documentation** (README, CHANGELOG, SECURITY_AUDIT, integration)
- **Ready for independent audit and institutional adoption**
- **Aligned with open standards (EIP Draft, ESG, post-quantum security)**
- **A real-world showcase of advanced Rust, Web3, and security engineering**
